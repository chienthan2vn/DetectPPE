# DetectPPE with yolo v5

-	Using yolo v5 model for identification: person, helmet, protective vest. The reason for choosing the yolo v5 model is that the yolo v5 model has improved performance due to the use of genetic algorithms, data enhancement techniques, and other improvements.
-	Dataset: A new dataset was built to detect helmets, helmet colors and people for this project, named Color Helmets and Vest (CHV) dataset with 1330 high quality images.
-	Due to the facilities, it is recommended to use the yolo v5s version to conduct the training process.
-	Protective gear recognition model with 88% precision 77% recall and 82% mAP@0.5.
